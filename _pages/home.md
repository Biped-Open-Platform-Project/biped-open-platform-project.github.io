The Biped Open Platform Project started with the idea to create an affordable yet capable platform for research in robotics and 2-legged locomotion. The components are mostly either 3d-printable, open-source, or off-the-shelf hardware. We're just getting started! At present, the project is in an early and untested stage, with many parts still undergoing actively design, testing, and changes. We make both early concepts and current versions available to allow reproduction, contributions, or spin-off projects. If you like or use this project, we'd love to hear about it!
