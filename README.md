## Biped Open Platform Project

The Biped Open Platform Project started with the idea to create an affordable yet capable platform for research in robotics and 2-legged locomotion. The components are mostly either 3d-printable, open-source, or off-the-shelf hardware. At present, the project is still in an early and untested stage, with many parts still actively being designed, tested, and changed. We make both early concepts and current versions available, to allow reproduction, contributions, or spin-off projects. If you like or use this project, we'd love to hear about it!
